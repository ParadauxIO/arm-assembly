Main:

  @ Write an ARM Assembly Language Program that will divide a
  @   value, a, in R2 by another value, b, in R3.

  @ We can't assume it's already zero
  LDR R0, =0  @ This will store the quotient
  MOV R1, R2  @ This will store the modulus
  
  @ R0 = R2 / R3
  @ R4 = Modulus (the remainder)

  @ If R2 == R3, R0 = 1, R1 = 0

  @ while ( R1 >= R3) {
  @     R0 = R0 + 1
